- The Team token doesn't work for the example in the docs. You get an
  "unathorized" error.
- Having different authentication headers for different token types is confusing
  and not well-documented. It requires you to write extra code to handle the
  different token types.
- Error messages are not helpful. For example, I ran into a lot of "Problem
  processing request".
- I couldn't find any comprehensive API documentation on the website.
- The projects "Fetch All Your Projects" example in the docs is out of date and
  doesn't work.
